This is example code for the Hammer parsing library to recognize the delimited
base64 file format specified in ../doc/delimitedbase64spec.txt.

It was developed with Hammer commit 45d28c3.  Hammer is in active development,
so there are no guarantees that this works with the current version.  For
development, this .c file was placed in Hammer's examples directory and minor
modifications to Hammer's makefiles were made.
