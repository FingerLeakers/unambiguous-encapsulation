This is the RS232 tapping module for the Daisho development board.

In order to use the USB core you must add the common/usb3 directory to the
"Project Libraries" section of the project settings dialog in Quartus II.
(This should work by default if this is checked out from github)

This is *VERY* early in the development phase - it doesn't even tap the lines.
